# Wine Mega
**Wine-mega** is a fork of wine combined with latest staging patches, vkd3d and other useful things, to be all-in-one bleeding-edge bundle.

It will be maintained in buildable state and kept up-to-date with latest wine and additions.

! See README for generic information about **wine** !

Current version of **wine-mega** runs Cyberpunk 2077 smoothly out-of-the-box, no additional configuration or external libraries (such as d3d12.dll) needed!
